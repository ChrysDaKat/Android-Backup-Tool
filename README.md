# Android Backup & Restore Tool
A simple yet powerful desktop application for Windows, built with Python and customtkinter, that allows users to back up and restore data from their Android devices using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).

Features
User-Friendly GUI: A clean and modern interface makes the backup process easy for all users.

Device Detection: Automatically detects connected Android devices and their authorization status.

Selective Folder Backup: Scan your device's storage, see the size of each major folder, and choose exactly which folders you want to back up.

Full Application Backup: A one-click solution to back up your installed applications and their data (for apps that allow it).

Timestamped Backups: Each backup is saved in a neatly organized, timestamped folder to prevent overwrites and keep your backups organized.

Progress and Time Estimation: A progress bar and an estimated time remaining give you a clear idea of how long backups will take.

Built-in Instructions: A "How to Use" tab provides clear, step-by-step instructions right within the app.
